# LAMMPS-Polymers
Project 3 MSE563

## Dependencies:
-LAMMPS GPU Version
-Python 3 (numpy, matplotlib)
-VMD for visualization

## Directory
- 'lammps-input' - This directory includes LAMMPS input files to run NVT simulations and initial configuraiton data files.
- 'scripts' - This includes notebooks of Python scripts for initial configurations, analysis, and plotting.
- 'slurm-batch-scripts' - Slurm script for Borah.
- 'results' - Output files from my simulations.

## Directions to run:

Start an interactive session on Borah On-Demand Jupyter Lab with GPU nodes. At this step, in the commands, you can do:

module load lammps_gpu

If you forget this step, you can later run it in the command line.
